        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Anastasiia Tokareva, currently residing in Japan. I have a strong
          academic background in English, History, and Law, complemented by
          extensive experience as a history teacher, ALT, and in administrative
          roles within educational and governmental settings. Since 2022, I have
          been working in a Japanese school, applying my expertise in education
          and administration in an international context.
        </p>

        <p>
          My decision to transition into IT was driven by my passion for
          technology and problem-solving. I have always been intrigued by the
          way technology shapes our world and wanted to be a part of that
          transformation. My background in education has equipped me with strong
          analytical skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas
          effectively. These skills are crucial in IT, where understanding
          client needs and translating them into functional and user-friendly
          solutions is key.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my training in frontend development, I discovered a new passion
          for creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. I
          excelled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like
          Bootstrap and React. I also developed proficiency in using tools like
          Figma for design prototyping and Git for version control. My ability
          to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies, combined with my solid
          foundation in project management and teamwork, makes me a strong
          candidate for any IT team.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am particularly interested in positions where I can continue to grow
          as a frontend developer and contribute to innovative projects. I
          believe that my unique combination of skills in education,
          administration, and technology allows me to bring a fresh perspective
          to the table. I am eager to apply my technical skills and creativity
          to solve real-world problems and deliver high-quality digital
          experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why should you hire me? I bring a blend of analytical thinking,
          creativity, and a deep understanding of user experience to the role.
          My background in education has taught me the importance of clear
          communication, patience, and perseverance—all of which are essential
          qualities in a developer. I am not only passionate about technology
          but also about helping others and making a positive impact through my
          work. I am confident that I can bring value to your team by leveraging
          my diverse skill set and my unwavering commitment to continuous
          learning and improvement.
